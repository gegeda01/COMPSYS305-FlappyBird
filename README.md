**A Brief Introduction of our project:**

Our game is called Flappy Doge.It is a game similar to Flappy Bird that is played using mouse, push buttons and switches on the DE0 board and displayed through a VGA monitor. 

**How to play:**

The player is suggested to start the game under training mode at first as he/she needs to get familiar with the game.The player controls the motion of the doge by clicking the left mouse button. Collision with pipes will reduce the current life points while collision with gifts will help the player gain life points. The initial life points for two modes are both set as 5. During the game, the player is allowed to continue the game when collision happens with pipes as long as his/her life point is more than zero. Once the life point becomes zero, the game ends. However, the player can still retry unlimited times by pressing the left mouse button when the game ends. After switching to normal game mode by switching off switch 9, the game will have three levels of difficulty. The speed will get faster after every 10 pipes. The maximum speed is limited when the player passes 40 pipes.

**General set up:**

DE0 board, VGA screen with a resolution of 640*480 pixels and a PS/2 mouse.
